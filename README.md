# Solitaire-Backend
Simple solitaire backend
In this project l have included some code you can easily integrate in any project with framework that supports kotlin, in my case Android 
the next phase of this project will be merged with Anko, as we will use Anko in Android for building the UI
You can use any other of your choice though
For Anko check out the Solitaire UI repository
